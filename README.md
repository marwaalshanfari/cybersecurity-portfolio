# 📁 Project Experience
🔹 Project 1: GAN-Based Data Balancing for Network Intrusion Detection

- Objective:
To address the class imbalance problem in network intrusion detection systems by generating high-quality synthetic attack traffic and evaluating its impact on detection performance.

- Tools Used:
Python, TensorFlow, SDV (CTGAN, TVAE), Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Methodology:

Created an imbalanced network traffic dataset representing normal and attack flows.

Implemented and trained three generative models: Vanilla GAN, CTGAN, and TVAE to synthesize attack traffic.

Balanced the dataset using synthetic samples generated by each model.

Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC.

Compared models to demonstrate the accuracy paradox in imbalanced security data.

- Outcomes:

CTGAN produced the most realistic synthetic data for mixed tabular network features.

Improved attack detection performance, particularly in Recall and F1-Score, which are critical for security systems.

Gained strong hands-on experience in applying GANs for cybersecurity analytics and evaluating ML models on imbalanced datasets.


🔹 Project 2: CVE Monitoring and Risk Analysis Tool Using Shodan API

- Objective:
To develop a monitoring and analytics tool that identifies vulnerabilities associated with exposed network services and evaluates their potential risk to an organization.

- Tools Used:
Python, Shodan API, NVD CVE Database, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

- Methodology:

Built a Python-based monitoring tool to query a list of IP addresses using the Shodan API.

Retrieved and analyzed CVE details, including severity scores and vulnerability descriptions.

Visualized findings using charts and summary tables to support risk assessment.

Provided analytical insights and recommended mitigation actions based on detected vulnerabilities.

- Outcomes:

Successfully identified critical and high-severity CVEs affecting exposed services.

Strengthened skills in threat intelligence integration and vulnerability assessment.

Demonstrated the ability to translate raw CVE data into meaningful security insights for decision-making.


🔹 Project 3: Advanced Network Security Programming – Behavioral Traffic Analysis

- Objective:
To design a self-learning security agent capable of distinguishing between benign and malicious network behavior using machine learning techniques.

- Tools Used:
Python, Scapy, Scikit-learn, Shodan API, Streamlit (for visualization)

- Methodology:

Developed Python scripts to generate benign and attack traffic against a controlled target environment.

Captured live traffic using Scapy and extracted statistical features such as packet size variance and inter-arrival time.

Trained and evaluated a machine learning classifier to distinguish malicious behavior.

Visualized detection results through a real-time security dashboard.

- Outcomes:

Successfully classified network traffic based on behavioral characteristics rather than static rules.

Enhanced practical understanding of SOC-style threat detection and behavioral security models.

Gained experience in integrating traffic analysis, ML classification, and real-time visualization.
